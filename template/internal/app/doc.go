// Package app is the composition root, laid out as one file per layer of
// the architecture: infrastructure.go constructs the services the
// application is composed on, admin.go the administrative services and
// their /admin mount, domain.go the domain services and their /api mount,
// and reactors.go the event-driven entry points. routes.go is the list of
// mounts, and middleware.go declares the router-level middleware stack,
// outermost first. Each layer file constructs its layer and owns its mount,
// so the package's file list is the architecture's layer list. Extending
// the service means editing a layer file's body; the signatures, cmd/server,
// and [App.Run] stay untouched.
//
// [New] is the cold start, with no I/O: it constructs infrastructure (each
// service registering on the coordinator where it is constructed), the
// admin layer over it, the domain over it, and the reactors over both, then
// assembles the router from the mounts and the middleware stack, and
// declares the server as the coordinator's root-stage service — started
// after every infrastructure stage and drained first, so in-flight requests
// complete before the infrastructure beneath them closes. The probes
// register on the router's native mux, outside every module's middleware,
// and query the coordinator live on every request, aggregating it under the
// "lifecycle" name ahead of its services' own checks. Wiring mistakes panic
// at construction.
//
// Routes and reactors are the two ways a domain service enters the running
// process: a route is driven by a caller, a reactor by an occurrence the
// process receives or discovers. Both take *Domain; neither is a domain
// service itself.
//
// [App.Run] is the hot start plus shutdown, delegated to the coordinator,
// and returns the process exit code.
