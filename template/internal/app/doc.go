// Package app is the composition root. It describes the service as one
// go-core dependency graph, and each architecture layer has one file, which
// defines the layer's nodes in its define function and owns its mount, so
// the layer files are the architecture's layer list:
//
//   - infrastructure.go: defineInfrastructure, the configuration and the
//     services the application is composed on (the logger, in the
//     template baseline);
//   - admin.go: defineAdmin, the administrative services, and their /admin
//     mount;
//   - domain.go: defineDomain, the domain services, and their /api mount;
//   - reactors.go: defineReactors, the process-lifetime entry points an
//     occurrence drives;
//   - server.go: defineServer, the request edge: the readiness the probes
//     report, the router, and the server;
//   - routes.go: the list of mounts;
//   - middleware.go: the router-level middleware stack, outermost first.
//
// [Nodes] holds one handle per node, the single description of what the
// service is composed of: each define function fills its own part of one
// Nodes value, and its constructors read the lower layers' nodes from it
// with Use. [App] is the described process. [New] is the cold start: it
// describes the graph, layer by layer, lowest first, constructs nothing,
// and cannot fail. [App.Graph] and [App.Nodes] publish the graph and its
// handles, so a caller can Observe or Replace a node before Run. [App.Run]
// is the hot start plus shutdown: it builds the graph from the config, the
// logger, the server, and each reactor as roots, hands the System to go-core's
// lifecycle Coordinator, and returns the process exit code. A constructor's
// error is reported there as the service failing; a wiring mistake panics
// during Build.
//
// What a node takes part in is inferred from its value's methods: a
// lifecycle.Starter or Stopper is started or stopped, a Subsystem is both,
// a ReadinessChecker joins the readiness probe, and a Monitored has its
// runtime error watched. Nodes start in layer order and drain in reverse.
// The server orders itself after every reactor, so it is alone in the top
// layer: it starts after every other node and drains first, so in-flight
// requests complete before what they run on closes. The service's logger
// reaches the server, the middleware, and every mount's error writer. The
// probes register on the router's native mux, outside every module's
// middleware, query live on every request through the readiness node's
// value, and report the Coordinator's status under the "lifecycle" name,
// ahead of the nodes' own checks in layer, then definition, order.
//
// Routes and reactors are the two ways the running process is entered: a
// caller drives a route, and an occurrence the process receives or
// discovers drives a reactor. A route reads the domain nodes, and a
// reactor may; neither is a domain service itself. Extending the service
// means defining a node in its layer's define function, and appending a
// reactor's node to Nodes.Reactors; the signatures, cmd/server, and
// [App.Run] stay untouched.
