// Infrastructure holds the services an application is composed on, one
// concrete field per service: the logger in the template baseline; a
// database pool, storage, or auth client as a service grows. A field either
// exists or the build fails, so a wiring mistake surfaces at compile time;
// roles sharing a type (a write pool and a read pool) are distinct fields,
// distinguished by name. The struct stops at the composition root: the
// layer files read its fields, and a domain package receives its
// dependencies as constructor parameters, never the struct itself.

// newInfrastructure constructs the infrastructure services in one place, in
// dependency order, each registering on lc where it is built — as a
// lifecycle.Service with the stage that places it in the process's startup
// order — so a service cannot exist without a startup, shutdown, or
// readiness declaration. Construction opens nothing: connectivity belongs
// to a service's Start hook, so a failed cold start leaks no connections.
// lc goes unused today, because the template's one service, Logger, has no
// lifecycle; it stays a parameter so the first service that needs one — a
// database pool, for instance — registers here without a signature change.
