// Package integration is the service's integration tier: the harness that
// runs the composed service as the binary and drives it through its
// production seams, and, under the integration build tag, the suite that
// asserts the service's behavior through its API. The harness runs over
// the toolkit the SDKs ship, go-core's processtest and go-web-sdk's
// webtest; nothing in the runtime exists for the tests' sake.
//
//   - [Main] is the suite's TestMain: it builds cmd/server once per run.
//   - [Options] shapes one service process: the APP_* overrides it adds.
//   - [Start] runs the service on a reserved port and returns once it is
//     live; [Launch] returns without waiting, and [Service.Ready] waits.
//   - [Service] is one running process: [Service.Addr], [Service.URL], and
//     [Service.Client] reach it, and the embedded processtest.Process
//     stops it and reads its output and exit code.
//
// The harness is untagged, so the unit tier type-checks it on every pull
// request; the suite files carry the integration tag.
